remote_user@remote_host$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889
local_user@local_host$ ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 remote_user@remote_host
The first option -N tells SSH that no remote commands will be executed, and is useful for port forwarding. The second option -f has the effect that SSH will go to background, so the local tunnel-enabling terminal remains usable. The last option -L lists the port forwarding configuration (remote port 8889 to local port 8888).
